      <h2 class="push-1-4" id="about">Compact Music</h2>
      <p class="push-0 pad-b-1 pad-t-1">As a family owned company, Compact Music has been a leader in the Ottawa used-music industry since the 1980’s. Their heavy vinyl collection helped them outlast media giants for decades. Currently they have two locations located on Bank Street, and plan on expanding.<br>
      <br>
      The logo represents the best qualities of Compact Music’s identity: the modern, yet old school, values of the company and their root: vinyl. The logo’s blend between old school imagery and a modern sans serif font creates a harmony while being able to hold up with today’s industry standards.<br>
      <br>
      The restrictions given by the client was that it needed to stand out in mall signage. I did 2 rounds of logo concept sketches and once a concept I liked was chosen I did 3 rounds of refinement before going digital. I used classic rock imagery for inspiration and came up with a CM monogram play on a vinyl sleeve. I included an elite gold in the colour pallet in order to represent rarities and collectibles that a used record store may sell, such as gold records. I paired this colour with a complementary purple in order to really make the brand stand out.</p>
